# Setting up a project

If you would like to keep track of your wordcount for a specific project, you can set up a nifty little project card to keep track of things!

## 1. If you want to hide messages related to project setup, you can toggle off project command visibility using /preferences toggle:

![img](/img/2_preftoggle.png)
![img](/img/3_preftoggle.png)
![img](/img/4_preftoggle.png)

**Note: make sure it says your profile visibility was set to 'Hidden', not 'Visible'. If it says 'Visible', re-do the above steps:**

Now, when you use /profile commands, only you will be able to see the bot outputs:
