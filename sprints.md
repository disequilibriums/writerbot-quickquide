## Starting a sprint:<br><br>

1. To start a sprint, use the `sprint for` command and enter a value for the sprint length:

4. To join a sprint, use `/sprint join`. There are a few options here:

* `/sprint join normal` lets you choose an **initial** word count (ie. the word count of your document before the sprint), and a **project** to add your sprint word count to.
* `/sprint join no-wordcount` lets you sprint without needing to add a word count (ie. for editing/art/other creative purposes), though you can still select a **project**.
* `/sprint join same` lets you join with the same word count you had at the end of your last sprint.
* `/sprint join set default_join` lets you set your default join condition.

5. If you want to get notified when new sprints are starting, use the `/sprint notify` command and set it to 'Yes':

6. When the sprint concludes, you will be pinged. Enter your updated wordcount using `/sprint wc`:

7. If you need to have a sprint, you can use `/sprint leave`:
