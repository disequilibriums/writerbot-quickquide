## Starting a sprint:<br><br>

1. If there is not currently a sprint running, you can start your own! Use the `sprint for` command and enter a value for the sprint length:

2. If you click ***+4 more***, you can add additional settings:

## Joining a sprint:<br><br>

1. If you want to get notified when new sprints are starting, use the `/sprint notify` command and set it to 'Yes':

2. To join a sprint that someone else has started, use `/sprint join`. There are a few options here:  

* `/sprint join normal` lets you choose an **initial** wordcount (ie. the wordcount of your document before the sprint), and a **project** to add your sprint wordcount to.
* `/sprint join no-wordcount` lets you sprint without needing to add a wordcount (ie. for editing/art/other creative purposes). You can still select a **project**.
* `/sprint join same` lets you join with the same wordcount you had at the end of your last sprint.
* `/sprint join set default_join` lets you set your default join condition.

## Finishing a sprint:<br><br>

1. When the sprint concludes, you will be pinged. Enter your updated wordcount using `/sprint wc`:

2. Once all sprint participants have entered their word counts, you will receive a nice little scorecard:

3. If you need to leave a sprint before it concludes, you can use `/sprint leave`:

4. If you need to cancel a sprint you started, you can use `/sprint cancel `:
